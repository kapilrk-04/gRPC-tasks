# Labyrinth Game gRPC Server

## Overview
The Labyrinth Game is a server-side implementation that allows multiple players to navigate a grid-based labyrinth, collect coins, and encounter walls. The server uses gRPC for communication with client applications.

## Dependencies
- **grpc**: A high-performance RPC framework.
- **random**: Used for generating random numbers for the labyrinth dimensions, coin placement, and wall placement.
- **logging**: For logging server activities.

## Protobuf Definitions
This server relies on the following protobuf definitions (assumed to be defined in `labyrinth_pb2.py` and `labyrinth_pb2_grpc.py`):
- **`Grid`**: Represents the labyrinth grid.
- **`GridRow`**: Represents a row in the grid.
- **`LabyrinthInfo`**: Contains the width and height of the labyrinth.
- **`PlayerStatus`**: Contains player status information.
- **`MoveResponse`**: Response for movement actions.
- **`TilePosition`**: Represents the position of tiles in the grid.
- **`BombardaResponse`**: Response for the Bombarda spell action.

## Class: `LabyrinthServicer`
This class implements the labyrinth game logic and the gRPC service.

# Labyrinth Game gRPC Server

## Constructor
```python
def __init__(self):
    """Initializes the labyrinth with random dimensions, coin tiles, and wall tiles.
    Sets player attributes (position, health points, remaining spells, and score).
    """
```

## Methods

### GetGrid
```python
def GetGrid(self, request, context):
    """Returns the current grid layout of the labyrinth.
    
    Parameters:
    - request: Contains the request details.
    - context: Provides information about the RPC call.

    """
```

### GetLabyrinthInfo
```python
def GetLabyrinthInfo(self, request, context):
    """Provides information about the labyrinth's dimensions.
    
    Parameters:
    - request: Contains the request details.
    - context: Provides information about the RPC call.
    
    Returns: A LabyrinthInfo object containing the width and height.
    """
```

### GetPlayerStatus
```python
def GetPlayerStatus(self, request, context):
    """Returns the current status of the player.
    
    Parameters:
    - request: Contains the request details.
    - context: Provides information about the RPC call.
    
    Returns: A PlayerStatus object with the player's current position, health points, remaining spells, and score.
    """
```

### RegisterMove
```python
def RegisterMove(self, request, context):
    """Processes the player's movement in the labyrinth.
    
    Parameters:
    - request: Contains the direction of movement (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
    - context: Provides information about the RPC call.
    
    Returns: A MoveResponse indicating the result of the movement:
    - status=1: Successful move (normal or coin collection).
    - status=2: Moved to a wall or out of bounds.
    - status=3: Moved to the winning tile.
    - status=4: Player's health has reached zero.
    """
```

### Revelio
```python
def Revelio(self, request, context):
    """Reveals nearby tiles based on the player's spell usage.
    
    Parameters:
    - request: Contains the position and tile type to reveal.
    - context: Provides information about the RPC call.
    
    Returns: Yields TilePosition for the revealed tiles. Returns (-1, -1) if no spells are left.
    """
```

### Bombarda
```python
def Bombarda(self, request_iterator, context):
    """Processes the Bombarda spell, allowing the player to destroy walls or coins.
    
    Parameters:
    - request_iterator: An iterator containing tile positions to target for destruction.
    - context: Provides information about the RPC call.
    
    Returns: A BombardaResponse indicating the success or failure of the action.
    """
```

### Function: serve
```python
def serve():
    """Initializes and starts the gRPC server.
    
    Returns: None; the server runs indefinitely.
    """
```

## Logging
Logs are written to `labyrinth.log`, capturing key events and player actions in the server.

### Example Log Entry
```yaml
2024-10-22 10:00:00 - INFO - Width: 4, Height: 3
2024-10-22 10:00:01 - INFO - Coins: [(1, 2), (2, 0)]
```

## Usage
Ensure that the protobuf definitions are correctly implemented and compiled. Run the server using Python:
```bash
python server.py
```
The server will listen on port 50051 for incoming gRPC requests.


# Labyrinth Game gRPC Client

## Command Line Interface
The client presents a command line interface with the following commands:

1. **GetLabyrinthInfo**: Retrieve the dimensions of the labyrinth.
2. **GetPlayerStatus**: Retrieve the current status of the player.
3. **RegisterMove**: Move the player in a specified direction.
4. **Revelio**: Reveal nearby tiles.
5. **Bombarda**: Destroy specified tiles.

## Example Usage
To run the client, execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python client.py
```

## Logging
The client uses the Python `logging` module for logging events. By default, logs are printed to the console.

## Note
Ensure that the gRPC server is running and listening on `localhost:50051` before starting the client.
